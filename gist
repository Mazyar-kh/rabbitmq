The page you mentioned is a GitHub repository that provides instructions on how to set up SSL for RabbitMQ. The repository contains a script that automates the process of creating the necessary SSL certificates and configuring RabbitMQ to use them. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/homoprogramus/rabbitmq_ssl.git`.
2. Change to the directory of the cloned repository using the command `cd rabbitmq_ssl`.
3. Run the script `./rabbitmq_ssl.sh` to create the necessary SSL certificates and configure RabbitMQ to use them.
4. Follow the prompts provided by the script to complete the setup process.

After completing these steps, RabbitMQ should be configured to use SSL for secure communication. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. ðŸ˜Š
